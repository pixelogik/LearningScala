# LearningScala
Little toy sources I use to learn about different aspects of Scala.

I really like Scala and use it on the backend. Also doing iOS in Swift, Scala seems to me like a cousin of Swift in many ways. I can't talk about the one without mentioning the other. Both Swift and Scala have their strengths but if Swift would be available on the JVM I would totally use it on the backend because its syntax is friendlier and mostly because Optionals are just perfect in Swift. 

What Scala does much better is traits. The flexibility with these things is just awesome. Like Mixins in Python it makes it super easy to compose functionality. 

My dream: Akka in Swift on the JVM :) One day...
